We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications &quot;cjpeg&quot; and &quot;djpeg&quot;, which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays. These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->We have also included &quot;jpegtran&quot;, a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and &quot;rdjpgcom&quot; and &quot;wrjpgcom&quot;, two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.

It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don&#39;t know much about data compression in general.

Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).

The latest version of this document is Revision 3. And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N 5799 with title &quot;Evolution of JPEG&quot;, June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany.

If you modify gd, we ask that you share the modifications with us so they can be added to the distribution. See gd.html for details. gd has been compiled in various forms on all major platforms. It is happiest on a machine with 32-bit addressing and a proper stack (ie, anything running Unix, VMS, Windows NT or any other modern operating system), but is entirely usable under DOS and Windows. Note, however, that the flood-fill routines are mildly recursive and may fail on machines with tiny stack areas. Also, the fonts require a significant amount of memory (they are optimized more for speed than for size), but they need not be linked by applications that do not use them. Otherwise the code is highly portable as long as you have an ANSI C compiler.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->Full documentation is provided in HTML (World Wide Web) format in the file gd.html (part of this distribution).
