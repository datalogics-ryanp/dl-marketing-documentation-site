JPEG (pronounced &quot;jay-peg&quot;) is a standardized compression method for full-color and grayscale images.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes. Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren&#39;t implemented yet. We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications &quot;cjpeg&quot; and &quot;djpeg&quot;, which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays. These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->We have also included &quot;jpegtran&quot;, a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and &quot;rdjpgcom&quot; and &quot;wrjpgcom&quot;, two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful. In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG. (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.) Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code. We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.

This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG. It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don&#39;t know much about data compression in general. The book&#39;s JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you&#39;ve got one here...<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook &quot;JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard&quot; by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1. Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2). Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation of the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT technology. If you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book, then you are in delusion. The real fundamentals and corresponding potential of DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for all the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.

The latest version of this document is Revision 3. And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N 5799 with title &quot;Evolution of JPEG&quot;, June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany. IJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible color transform for improved lossless compression which is described in a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/ WG1 N 6080 with title &quot;JPEG 9 Lossless Coding&quot;, June/July 2012, Paris, France.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format.

It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note&#39;s design.

One of those fakes is released by members of the ISO committee and just uses the name of libjpeg for misdirection of people, similar to the abuse of the name JPEG as described above, while having nothing in common with actual IJG libjpeg distributions and containing mathematically incorrect code. The other one claims to be a &quot;derivative&quot; or &quot;fork&quot; of the original libjpeg, but violates the license conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above and violates basic C programming properties.

The latest version of this document is Revision 3. And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N 5799 with title &quot;Evolution of JPEG&quot;, June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany.

If you modify gd, we ask that you share the modifications with us so they can be added to the distribution. See gd.html for details. gd has been compiled in various forms on all major platforms. It is happiest on a machine with 32-bit addressing and a proper stack (ie, anything running Unix, VMS, Windows NT or any other modern operating system), but is entirely usable under DOS and Windows. Note, however, that the flood-fill routines are mildly recursive and may fail on machines with tiny stack areas. Also, the fonts require a significant amount of memory (they are optimized more for speed than for size), but they need not be linked by applications that do not use them. Otherwise the code is highly portable as long as you have an ANSI C compiler.<!--]--></p><p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><!--[-->Full documentation is provided in HTML (World Wide Web) format in the file gd.html (part of this distribution).
