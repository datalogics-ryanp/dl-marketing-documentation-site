The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.:br<strong class="font-semibold"><!--[-->Expanded support for Output Intent<!--]--></strong>. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.:br<strong class="font-semibold"><!--[-->PDEElement color space support<!--]--></strong>. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.:br<strong class="font-semibold"><!--[-->UTF-16 support<!--]--></strong>. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.:br<strong class="font-semibold"><!--[-->New APIs<!--]--></strong>.

The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.:br",{"type":21,"tag":26,"props":3669,"children":3670},{},[3671],{"type":30,"value":3672},"Expanded support for Output Intent",{"type":30,"value":3674},". Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.:br",{"type":21,"tag":26,"props":3676,"children":3677},{},[3678],{"type":30,"value":3679},"PDEElement color space support",{"type":30,"value":3681},". Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.:br",{"type":21,"tag":26,"props":3683,"children":3684},{},[3685],{"type":30,"value":3686},"UTF-16 support",{"type":30,"value":3688},". The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.:br",{"type":21,"tag":26,"props":3690,"children":3691},{},[3692],{"type":30,"value":3693},"New APIs",{"type":30,"value":3695},".
