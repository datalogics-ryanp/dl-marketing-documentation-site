XFA forms can be saved internally in PDF files. Unlike AcroForm, XFA forms can allow text reflow, so that text fields can resize to allow more content if needed. Dynamic XFA forms can also be interactive, as the form document is built using a series of templates. The form document can respond to the information that a user enters or selects and display a different set of form fields relevant to the userâ€™s answer."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Many XFA documents remain in use, but most PDF documents use AcroForm instead.
