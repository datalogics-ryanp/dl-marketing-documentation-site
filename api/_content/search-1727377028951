Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.:brCurrent open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:* International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01:brBlack Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.:brExpanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.:brPDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.:brUTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.:brNew APIs.

If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly the order listed) before diving into the code. OVERVIEW ======== This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding, and transcoding. JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression method for full-color and grayscale images. This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes. Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard. We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications. In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays. These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application. We have also included \"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files. The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful. In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG. (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.) Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code. We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it. We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products. No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES. LEGAL ISSUES ============ In plain English: 1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!) 2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us. 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code. In legalese: The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided \"AS IS\", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy. This software is copyright (C) 1991-2020, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding. All Rights Reserved except as specified below. Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group\". (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind. These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us. Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's software\". We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.  The Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable. REFERENCES ========== We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to understand the innards of the JPEG software. The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is Wallace, Gregory K. \"The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard\", Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44. (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression, applications of JPEG, and related topics.) If you don't have the CACM issue handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf. The file (actually a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics) omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections and some added material. Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes. A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in \"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1. This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG. It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general. The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here... The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1. Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2). Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation of the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT technology. If you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book, then you are in delusion. The real fundamentals and corresponding potential of DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for all the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain. The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods. Part 1 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81. Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83. IJG JPEG 8 introduced an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale extension which is specified in two documents: A contributed document at ITU and ISO with title \"ITU-T JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T T.81 for Advanced Image Coding\", April 2006, Geneva, Switzerland. The latest version of this document is Revision 3. And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N 5799 with title \"Evolution of JPEG\", June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany. IJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible color transform for improved lossless compression which is described in a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/ WG1 N 6080 with title \"JPEG 9 Lossless Coding\", June/July 2012, Paris, France. The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format. For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, version 2. JFIF version 1 has been adopted as Recommendation ITU-T T.871 (05/2011) : Information technology - Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF). It is available as a free download in PDF file format from http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871. A PDF file of the older JFIF document is available at http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf. The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz. The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6). Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7). Copies of this Note can be obtained from http://www.ijg.org/files/. It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note. ARCHIVE LOCATIONS ================= The \"official\" archive site for this software is www.ijg.org. The most recent released version can always be found there in directory \"files\". This particular version will be archived as http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v9d.tar.gz, and in Windows-compatible \"zip\" archive format as http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsr9d.zip. The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a source of some general information about JPEG. It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/ and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.

Thank to Istvan Sebestyen and Joan L. Mitchell for inviting me to the ITU JPEG (Study Group 16) meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.  Thank to Thomas Wiegand and Gary Sullivan for inviting me to the Joint Video Team (MPEG & ITU) meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. Thank to Thomas Richter and Daniel Lee for inviting me to the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 (previously known as JPEG, together with ITU-T SG16) meeting in Berlin, Germany. Thank to John Korejwa and Massimo Ballerini for inviting me to fruitful consultations in Boston, MA and Milan, Italy. Thank to Hendrik Elstner, Roland Fassauer, Simone Zuck, Guenther Maier-Gerber, Walter Stoeber, Fred Schmitz, and Norbert Braunagel for corresponding business development. Thank to Nico Zschach and Dirk Stelling of the technical support team at the Digital Images company in Halle for providing me with extra equipment for configuration tests. Thank to Richard F. Lyon (then of Foveon Inc.) for fruitful communication about JPEG configuration in Sigma Photo Pro software.  Thank to Andrew Finkenstadt for hosting the ijg.org site. Thank to Thomas G. Lane for the original design and development of this singular software package. Thank to Lars Goehler, Andreas Heinecke, Sebastian Fuss, Yvonne Roebert, Andrej Werner, and Ulf-Dietrich Braumann for support and public relations. FILE FORMAT WARS ================ The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (previously known as JPEG, together with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name \"JPEG\" which is misleading because these formats are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG and are based on faulty technologies. IJG therefore does not and will not support such momentary mistakes (see REFERENCES). There exist also distributions under the name \"OpenJPEG\" promoting such kind of formats which is misleading because they don't support original JPEG images. We have no sympathy for the promotion of inferior formats. Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files. Don't use an incompatible file format! (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG image files indefinitely.) The ISO committee pretends to be \"responsible for the popular JPEG\" in their public reports which is not true because they don't respond to actual requirements for the maintenance of the original JPEG specification. Furthermore, the ISO committee pretends to \"ensure interoperability\" with their standards which is not true because their \"standards\" support only application-specific and proprietary use cases and contain mathematically incorrect code. There are currently different distributions in circulation containing the name \"libjpeg\" which is misleading because they don't have the features and are incompatible with formats supported by actual IJG libjpeg distributions. One of those fakes is released by members of the ISO committee and just uses the name of libjpeg for misdirection of people, similar to the abuse of the name JPEG as described above, while having nothing in common with actual IJG libjpeg distributions and containing mathematically incorrect code. The other one claims to be a \"derivative\" or \"fork\" of the original libjpeg, but violates the license conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above and violates basic C programming properties. We have no sympathy for the release of misleading, incorrect and illegal distributions derived from obsolete code bases. Don't use an obsolete code base! According to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) law, IJG has the lawful and legal right to foreclose on certain standardization bodies and other institutions or corporations that knowingly perform substantial and systematic deceptive acts and practices, fraud, theft, and damaging of the value of the people of this planet without their knowing, willing and intentional consent. The titles, ownership, and rights of these institutions and all their assets are now duly secured and held in trust for the free people of this planet. People of the planet, on every country, may have a financial interest in the assets of these former principals, agents, and beneficiaries of the foreclosed institutions and corporations. IJG asserts what is: that each man, woman, and child has unalienable value and rights granted and deposited in them by the Creator and not any one of the people is subordinate to any artificial principality, corporate fiction or the special interest of another without their appropriate knowing, willing and intentional consent made by contract or accommodation agreement. IJG expresses that which already was. The people have already determined and demanded that public administration entities, national governments, and their supporting judicial systems must be fully transparent, accountable, and liable. IJG has secured the value for all concerned free people of the planet.  A partial list of foreclosed institutions and corporations (\"Hall of Shame\") is currently prepared and will be published later. TO DO ===== Version 9 is the second release of a new generation JPEG standard to overcome the limitations of the original JPEG specification, and is the first true source reference JPEG codec. More features are being prepared for coming releases... Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@jpegclub.org. libpng COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE ========================================= PNG Reference Library License version 2 --------------------------------------- Copyright (c) 1995-2019 The PNG Reference Library Authors.

If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly the order listed) before diving into the code. OVERVIEW ======== This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding, and transcoding. JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression method for full-color and grayscale images. This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes. Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard. We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications. In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays. These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application. We have also included \"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files. The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful. In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG. (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.) Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code. We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it. We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products. No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES. LEGAL ISSUES ============ In plain English: 1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!) 2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us. 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code. In legalese: The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided \"AS IS\", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy. This software is copyright (C) 1991-2020, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding. All Rights Reserved except as specified below. Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group\". (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind. These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's software\". We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor. The Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable. REFERENCES ========== We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to understand the innards of the JPEG software. The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is Wallace, Gregory K. \"The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard\", Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44. (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression, applications of JPEG, and related topics.) If you don't have the CACM issue handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf. The file (actually a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics) omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections and some added material. Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes. A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in \"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1. This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG. It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general. The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here... The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1. Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2). Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation of the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT technology. If you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book, then you are in delusion. The real fundamentals and corresponding potential of DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for all the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain. The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods. Part 1 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81. Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83. IJG JPEG 8 introduced an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale extension which is specified in two documents: A contributed document at ITU and ISO with title \"ITU-T JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T T.81 for Advanced Image Coding\", April 2006, Geneva, Switzerland. The latest version of this document is Revision 3. And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N 5799 with title \"Evolution of JPEG\", June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany. IJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible color transform for improved lossless compression which is described in a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/ WG1 N 6080 with title \"JPEG 9 Lossless Coding\", June/July 2012, Paris, France. The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format. For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, version 2. JFIF version 1 has been adopted as Recommendation ITU-T T.871 (05/2011) : Information technology - Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF). It is available as a free download in PDF file format from http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871. A PDF file of the older JFIF document is available at http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf. The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz. The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6). Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note 2 (Compression tag 7). Copies of this Note can be obtained from http://www.ijg.org/files/. It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note. ARCHIVE LOCATIONS ================= The \"official\" archive site for this software is www.ijg.org. The most recent released version can always be found there in directory \"files\".

Thank to Istvan Sebestyen and Joan L. Mitchell for inviting me to the ITU JPEG (Study Group 16) meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. Thank to Thomas Wiegand and Gary Sullivan for inviting me to the Joint Video Team (MPEG & ITU) meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. Thank to Thomas Richter and Daniel Lee for inviting me to the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 (previously known as JPEG, together with ITU-T SG16) meeting in Berlin, Germany. Thank to John Korejwa and Massimo Ballerini for inviting me to fruitful consultations in Boston, MA and Milan, Italy. Thank to Hendrik Elstner, Roland Fassauer, Simone Zuck, Guenther Maier-Gerber, Walter Stoeber, Fred Schmitz, and Norbert Braunagel for corresponding business development. Thank to Nico Zschach and Dirk Stelling of the technical support team at the Digital Images company in Halle for providing me with extra equipment for configuration tests. Thank to Richard F. Lyon (then of Foveon Inc.) for fruitful communication about JPEG configuration in Sigma Photo Pro software. Thank to Andrew Finkenstadt for hosting the ijg.org site. Thank to Thomas G. Lane for the original design and development of this singular software package. Thank to Lars Goehler, Andreas Heinecke, Sebastian Fuss, Yvonne Roebert, Andrej Werner, and Ulf-Dietrich Braumann for support and public relations. FILE FORMAT WARS ================ The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (previously known as JPEG, together with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name \"JPEG\" which is misleading because these formats are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG and are based on faulty technologies. IJG therefore does not and will not support such momentary mistakes (see REFERENCES). There exist also distributions under the name \"OpenJPEG\" promoting such kind of formats which is misleading because they don't support original JPEG images. We have no sympathy for the promotion of inferior formats. Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files. Don't use an incompatible file format! (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG image files indefinitely.) The ISO committee pretends to be \"responsible for the popular JPEG\" in their public reports which is not true because they don't respond to actual requirements for the maintenance of the original JPEG specification. Furthermore, the ISO committee pretends to \"ensure interoperability\" with their standards which is not true because their \"standards\" support only application-specific and proprietary use cases and contain mathematically incorrect code. There are currently different distributions in circulation containing the name \"libjpeg\" which is misleading because they don't have the features and are incompatible with formats supported by actual IJG libjpeg distributions. One of those fakes is released by members of the ISO committee and just uses the name of libjpeg for misdirection of people, similar to the abuse of the name JPEG as described above, while having nothing in common with actual IJG libjpeg distributions and containing mathematically incorrect code. The other one claims to be a \"derivative\" or \"fork\" of the original libjpeg, but violates the license conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above and violates basic C programming properties. We have no sympathy for the release of misleading, incorrect and illegal distributions derived from obsolete code bases. Don't use an obsolete code base! According to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) law, IJG has the lawful and legal right to foreclose on certain standardization bodies and other institutions or corporations that knowingly perform substantial and systematic deceptive acts and practices, fraud, theft, and damaging of the value of the people of this planet without their knowing, willing and intentional consent. The titles, ownership, and rights of these institutions and all their assets are now duly secured and held in trust for the free people of this planet. People of the planet, on every country, may have a financial interest in the assets of these former principals, agents, and beneficiaries of the foreclosed institutions and corporations. IJG asserts what is: that each man, woman, and child has unalienable value and rights granted and deposited in them by the Creator and not any one of the people is subordinate to any artificial principality, corporate fiction or the special interest of another without their appropriate knowing, willing and intentional consent made by contract or accommodation agreement. IJG expresses that which already was. The people have already determined and demanded that public administration entities, national governments, and their supporting judicial systems must be fully transparent, accountable, and liable. IJG has secured the value for all concerned free people of the planet. A partial list of foreclosed institutions and corporations (\"Hall of Shame\") is currently prepared and will be published later.

DLI GD COPYRIGHT 1994,1995 BY THE QUEST CENTER AT COLD SPRING HARBOR LABS. Permission granted for unlimited use, provided that Thomas Boutell and the Quest Center at Cold Spring Harbor Labs are given credit for the library in the user-visible documentation of your software. If you modify gd, we ask that you share the modifications with us so they can be added to the distribution. See gd.html for details. gd has been compiled in various forms on all major platforms. It is happiest on a machine with 32-bit addressing and a proper stack (ie, anything running Unix, VMS, Windows NT or any other modern operating system), but is entirely usable under DOS and Windows. Note, however, that the flood-fill routines are mildly recursive and may fail on machines with tiny stack areas. Also, the fonts require a significant amount of memory (they are optimized more for speed than for size), but they need not be linked by applications that do not use them. Otherwise the code is highly portable as long as you have an ANSI C compiler. Full documentation is provided in HTML (World Wide Web) format in the file gd.html (part of this distribution). You can access the latest version of the file at the URL \"http://siva.cshl.org/gd/gd.html\". If you are unfamiliar with the World Wide Web (when was this actually written?), consult the Frequently Asked Questions posting of the appropriate comp.infosystems.www.browsers subgroup for your operating system to obtain more information on where to locate a hypertext browser. The text-based browser \"Lynx\" does a particularly good job of navigating the manual and will run on nearly anything. Netscape works fine too. If you don't have the patience to consult the manual first, build and examine gddemo.c (see the Makefile) and run it. It will read in demoin.gif and output demoout.gif, which you will want to examine with your GIF viewer to see the results.

Adobe Inc. developed Adobe Acrobat Forms, or AcroForm, in 1998.  AcroForm is the original PDF forms technology and it remains the primary method for building PDF forms documents today. Many PDF users use Adobe Acrobat to build electronic forms and surveys, adding text fields, check boxes, radio buttons, bar codes, and other form field elements to a PDF document. XFA, or XML Forms Architecture, is a set of proprietary XML specifications for use with web forms. In 2002 Adobe bought the company that created the XFA standard. XFA can be created and managed using the Adobe Experience Manager, previously known as Adobe LiveCycle Designer software. XFA forms can be saved internally in PDF files. Unlike AcroForm, XFA forms can allow text reflow, so that text fields can resize to allow more content if needed. Dynamic XFA forms can also be interactive, as the form document is built using a series of templates. The form document can respond to the information that a user enters or selects and display a different set of form fields relevant to the user’s answer. Many XFA documents remain in use, but most PDF documents use AcroForm instead. AcroForms are compatible with a much wider range of software applications, as well as with Acrobat itself. Note also that XFA was deprecated in the new PDF 2.0 format, and is not permitted for use with special ISO formats for PDF documents, including PDF/A, PDF/E, PDF/X, PDF/UA, and PDF/VT. Further, XFA is not supported on mobile devices.

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.:brCurrent open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:* International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01:brBlack Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.:brExpanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.:brPDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.:brUTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.:brNew APIs.

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.:brCurrent open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:* International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01:brBlack Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.:brExpanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.:brPDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.:brUTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.:brNew APIs.

With this product you can count on maximum file size reduction and enterprise-level accuracy and reliability. PDF Optimizer offers flexible control, allowing you to optimize your documents for a wide range of document workflows. You can optimize a PDF document so that it will download faster, open more quickly in a web browser or PDF viewer, print more efficiently, or be better suited for long-term preservation. Select exactly what type of content you prefer to preserve or discard, fine-tune image compression options, and optionally convert to a PDF/A or PDF/X standard.  With PDF Optimizer, you can ensure that your PDF documents will always be as small as possible while still meeting your needs. Optimizing can also improve the performance of a PDF document without necessarily making that document smaller.  The optimization process can discard objects and features within a PDF document that require excess processing time. A complicated PDF document with a lot of features will tend to take more time to load, regardless of the size.

This way you can create a workflow that uses PDF Optimizer to optimize large numbers of PDF documents automatically.  You can use your favorite scripting language to automatically generate a series of calls to PDF Optimizer, each with a unique name for the input PDF document and the output file. PDF Optimizer is a quick and easy way to convert a set of PDF files to make them easier to distribute. When you run PDF Optimizer, the program takes the input PDF document you provide, optimizes it, and then saves it as a new output PDF document. After PDF Optimizer finishes processing your document, you will see a summary statement describing how much the product has reduced the size of your source file, and what was changed or removed to make the output PDF document smaller. This summary appears by default, but if you don't need the summary you can disable it. You can also choose to generate an optional detailed Results Report, saved as a text file in a folder you select. Both of these reports are designed to make PDF Optimizer easier for you to use. As soon as you use the software to optimize one of your PDF documents, the product can provide details for you about the results—how much space was saved by reducing the resolution of individual images in the original document, embedding fonts, and removing objects like thumbnails, annotations, and JavaScript code.","titles":["PDF Optimizer"]},"175":{"title":"The PDF Optimizer Profile","content":"You can provide a variety of custom settings to tell PDF Optimizer exactly how you want it to optimize each PDF document.  For example, you can make a PDF smaller by choosing to downsample the images found in that document.  Downsampling an image reduces the resolution of that image and reduces its size as well. You could add a setting to a profile file that tells PDF Optimizer to discard bookmarks or attachments within a PDF document. The custom settings that you provide to PDF Optimizer to manage the process are all defined in a profile file. The profile is a JSON file that you need to specify in the command line statement. We provide a set of profile files with the product, including several for converting documents into PDF/A output.  These JSON files are stored in the OptimizationProfiles folder: compressionMedium.json. – This is the profile recommended for PDF documents to be optimized without a specific case in mind. It provides strong compression, and the loss in quality of images is minimal.compressionHigh.json – This profile is designed for maximum compression. For some documents this may mean a significant loss in the quality of images.compressionLow.json – This profile is designed for modest compression, and little to no loss in the quality of images.Digimaster.json. – This profile color converts images within a PDF document to gray scale and downsamples any images greater than 600 DPI resolution to 600 DPI. This profile is intended to be used with Kodak Digimaster printers. We provide a series of profiles designed to create an archived version of a document for long-term storage.* PDFA-1b.json. – Basic conformance with PDF/A archival standards.\nPDFA-2b.json. – Basic conformance with archival standards but revised for later versions of the PDF format. PDF/A-2 includes options for OpenType fonts, layers, attachments (which themselves must be PDF/A compliant) and JPEG 2000 image compression.PDFA-2u.json. – Matches PDF/A-2b but also requires that all text in the document have Unicode mappings.PDFA-3b.json. – Matches PDF/A-2b, except that it is possible to embed any kind of file in the PDF document. With PDF/A-3 a user can save an XML, CSV, CAD, spreadsheet, or other type of file in the PDF document and still conform to PDF/A standards.  The file embedded in the PDF/A-3 does not need to be converted to PDF/A itself.PDFA-3u.json. – Matches PDF/A-3b, but also requires that all text in the document have Unicode mappings.PDFA-4.json. – Based on PDF 2.0PDFA-4e.json. – Based on PDF 2.0 for Engineering documentsPDFA-4f.json. – Based on PDF 2.0 for embedded files in any formatPDFX-4.json. – Conformance with PDF/X-4 archival standard.PDFX-6.json. – Conformance with PDF/X-6 archival standard.printing.json. This profile is recommended for PDF documents to be sent to a printer. You can update these files as you like, but the content of your profile file must be valid JSON content. If you want to create your own custom profile, you can base your work on one of the profiles provided with the software installation package. But we recommend that you save a copy of the original JSON file and rename it, and then edit this copy instead.  This way you will preserve the original JSON profile for later reference.  Also, if you install an updated version of the software, the installation process will overwrite the original file, and any changes you made to that file will be lost.  Besides saving your own copy of the profile, you might also want to create a backup of your edited JSON profile in a different directory. You can use a JSON validator, like JSONLint, to check your JSON syntax (https://jsonlint.com).","titles":["PDF Optimizer"]},"176":{"title":"Installing PDF Optimizer: PDF Checker","content":"Note that when you install PDF Optimizer, you can also install a separate utility as well called PDF Checker.

You can define the settings involved in the optimization process, such as whether to remove embedded fonts and how much to compress images, in your JSON profile file. Also, several of the steps in the process are optional: 1.       Flattening transparencies found in the PDF input document (optional) 2.       Converting the colors in the PDF input document to a target color space, using a color profile and render intent provided by the user (optional) 3.       Optimizing content, including images, fonts, objects, and user data, and then the objects are compressed as a part of the cleanup process. 4.       Converting the optimized document so that it is compliant with the PDF/A or PDF/X specification (optional). These steps are described in detail in this document.","titles":["PDF Optimizer"]},"180":{"title":"Setting up your profile","content":"Your JSON profile file should include a list of settings that define exactly what kinds of changes you want to apply to your PDF document.  The PDF Optimizer offers a lot of different methods to optimize of a PDF document.  The options you select will depend on how you want to change your output PDF documents. Suppose you have a PDF document that is 18 MB and you want to make it smaller so that the file will be easier to distribute online.  If you expect that your readers will be opening the file in a browser window, and it doesn’t matter if the photographs and diagrams in the document appear with a lower resolution, you could make the document smaller by aggressively compressing the images included in the file. On the other hand, if you are working with a large PDF document that your customers are likely to want to print, but you want to make it smaller so that it downloads and prints more quickly, you probably want to leave the graphics alone.  They will need to appear as sharp as possible.  But you don’t need interactive content, like form fields, bookmarks, comments, or digital signatures.  You can use PDF Optimizer to remove items from the PDF document that will not appear on paper. Consider building a PDF document that you intend for people to read on smart phones and other mobile devices.  In this case you want to compress the document so that it opens as quickly as possible.  So you would reduce the size of the images in this case as well, but given that the screens are a lot smaller than a laptop or desktop monitor, you can reduce the resolution of the images in the PDF document to be less than a PDF document that is intended for opening in a browser window. All of the settings for compressing a document are optional and are turned off by default.  That means then that a setting is only applied if it is included in the JSON file. Flag settings must be set to “ON.”  Settings that are turned off do not need to be defined in the JSON profile file.  So if you wanted to you could create a custom JSON file with only a single setting, to compress images. Your JSON file might only hold five or six lines of text. Only use lowercase characters for the keys and values you add to the JSON file. The methods you can use to optimize a PDF document are sorted into different categories: Images                                 When a PDF document is created that includes photographs, diagrams or drawings, the original graphic file, such as a JPEG photograph or a PNG image, become images in that PDF file.  You can enter settings in the JSON profile file to compress these color, gray scale, or black & white images. Fonts                                     PDF documents can travel with the fonts that they need to access to properly render text.  Font files can be embedded within the PDF itself.  That way, no matter what machine is used to open a PDF file, the PDF is always guaranteed to look the same, and the viewing tool does not need to look for substitute fonts installed on the local desktop or laptop.  But these embedded font files can make the PDF larger, maybe a lot larger, if the document needs to express characters from an Asian font set, like Mandarin or Japanese. You can enter settings in your JSON profile file to remove individual font characters or sets that you don’t need, thus reducing the size of the PDF file. Transparency                     It is possible to stack objects, such as graphics, images, text boxes, and form fields, on top of each other on a PDF document.  These objects can be partially or fully transparent, and thus can interact in various ways with objects behind them. If a set of transparencies are stacked in a PDF file, each one contributes to the final result that appears on the page, such as the colors blending together into a final color that appears. To make a PDF document simpler you can flatten these transparencies.  The flattening process combines the layers of content on a PDF page, or a stack of transparent images or colors, and renders the result as a single image, blended color, or set of text.  For example, if a digital signature is flattened, the digital certificate key and related properties are removed from the signature field. The name of the person who signed the document and related information, such as the date and time stamp and the signer’s email address, appear on the page as text, but the signature field is no longer interactive. To flatten the transparencies within a PDF document, there needs to be a \"transparency/quality\" section in the JSON profile file. Objects                                Besides graphic images and font files, a variety of other objects can be saved within a PDF document. ·         Blocks of JavaScript code ·         Thumbnail images ·         Bookmarks ·         Tags ·         Alternate graphics images PDF Optimizer is designed to allow you to remove any of these objects from a PDF document. This serves to make the document smaller and easier to distribute. User Data                            It is possible to edit PDF documents using Adobe Acrobat and other viewing and editing tools.  For example, when reviewing the content in a PDF document, a user might want to add a comment.  It is also possible to attach external files to a PDF document so that the file is saved as a part of the PDF, or embed a hyperlink to a web page.  Finally, a user could add metadata.  PDF Optimizer can remove any of this content. It can also remove form fields, such as text boxes, check boxes, and radio buttons. Cleanup                               Use the Cleanup features in PDF Optimizer to set compression values for a PDF document.  You can compress the entire PDF document or parts of the content, and you can also remove redundant content or select a compression method to use, as well as other changes designed to make a PDF document open more quickly. General                                These options affect the PDF document as a whole, rather than individual features, like images or fonts or bookmarks. The setting provided under General allows you to force PDF Optimizer to generate a PDF output document even if this document will be larger than the input document it is intended to replace. Color Conversion             You can turn on this feature to direct PDF Optimizer to convert the colors in a PDF document to a color profile you select before optimizing that document. PDF/A Conversion           A PDF/A, or PDF Archive document, is a type of PDF file that is designed to be stored so that it can be accessed for many years to come.  PDF/A documents must be able to be opened and read using viewing tools available in the future, so they are designed to be self-contained.  For example, all of the fonts used in a PDF/A document must be embedded within the PDF document itself for the file to be considered PDF/A compliant.  You can turn on this option and prompt PDF Optimizer to save a PDF file as PDF/A compliant after the document is optimized. You can also define the color space used and determine how PDF Optimizer respond to errors during the conversion process. PDF/X Conversion            A PDF/X, is an ISO-standard version the PDF format. It’s a subset of the PDF standard that applies to Printing Workflows.","titles":["PDF Optimizer"]},"181":{"title":"Images","content":"","titles":["PDF Optimizer","Setting up your profile"]},"182":{"title":"Downsampling Images","content":"If you have images in a PDF document that you want to make smaller, and you know that these images don’t need to have a high resolution in the output file, you can reduce the resolution of these images.  You can also compress these images within the file.  Both steps will reduce the final size of the PDF document. In PDF Optimizer, the process of reducing the resolution of images is called downsampling. You can choose to downsample color images in a PDF document, or grayscale, or monochrome (black & white). The settings for reducing the resolution for these three kinds of images in a PDF document must be added separately to the JSON profile file.  Each type of image can have its own settings and resolution values. So you could, for example, enable resampling to only apply to the color images in a PDF document. Or you could include only grayscale and black and white images.","titles":["PDF Optimizer","Setting up your profile","Images"]},"183":{"title":"Downsampling and Recompression","content":"Downsampling reduces the size of the image directly by reducing the resolution.  In recompression, compressed images in a document are decompressed and then compressed again.  You can enter a recompression setting to change the compression algorithm used for recompression, such as ZIP, JPEG or Flate, and another setting to change the final image quality. The image quality is part of the compression method used.  If you add settings in the JSON profile file to downsample images, PDF Optimizer will also recompress the images involved whether you provide recompression settings or not. If you do not add recompression settings to the JSON profile, PDF Optimizer downsamples and recompresses each image in the PDF document using the default compression algorithm and quality value defined in the image itself. For example, if you provide downsample settings but not recompression settings in your JSON profile and apply that profile to a document that only holds images using JPEG compression, PDF Optimizer will use the JPEG compression method. It will also use the highest quality recompression setting available (“maximum”) to keep from reducing the quality of the images as they are recompressed. On the other hand, if you decide to leave out downsample settings from your JSON profile file, but add recompression settings, PDF Optimizer recompresses the images using the recompression algorithm you provide while keeping the image downsampling resolution (DPI) the same.  Note that if you add recompression settings you must include both values in the JSON file, the compression algorithm and the recompression quality level.","titles":["PDF Optimizer","Setting up your profile","Images","Downsampling Images"]},"184":{"title":"Image Resolution","content":"When we refer to the resolution of an image, we generally refer to the number of pixels in that image. This can be expressed in terms of megapixels, or in Dots per Inch (DPI).  With an image in a PDF document, the resolution of the image is expressed as a certain number of pixels wide and pixels high. The downsampling process involves changing the width and height of an image in pixels, in order to reach a given target resolution.  PDF Optimizer calculates the resolution for every image in the document. Keep in mind that the resolution values used with downsampling are distinct from the image quality settings used for image recompression. You can specify a target resolution to use for downsampling images in a document (target-dpi) and a trigger resolution (trigger-dpi).  If you decide to downsample an image type, both the target and the trigger resolution settings must be included in your profile file.  The target resolution defines the goal—the maximum resolution for every image in the file. So if you add a target resolution to your JSON profile and set that target resolution to 600 DPI, PDF Optimizer will downsample every graphic in the PDF document to 600 DPI unless it that image is already at 600 DPI or less. The trigger resolution, if used, defines the resolution PDF Optimizer uses as its starting point.  Any image with a resolution greater than the trigger resolution will be downsampled.  If an image has a resolution less than the trigger resolution, PDF Optimizer ignores it. So if you set the trigger resolution to 800 DPI, and the target resolution to 400 DPI, it means that you want to downsample every image in the PDF document to 400 DPI, but only if the image is larger than 800 DPI to begin with.  In this example you would be telling PDF Optimizer to look for only the really large images (the ones with a resolution at 800 DPI or more) and then downsample just those images to a certain set value, in this example 400 DPI. If the trigger resolution is 500 DPI, and the target resolution is 400 DPI, PDF Optimizer will not downsample an image if it is 480 DPI.  But if the trigger resolution is 500 and the target is 400, if PDF Optimizer finds an image with a resolution of 680 DPI, it will downsample it to 400 DPI.","titles":["PDF Optimizer","Setting up your profile","Images","Downsampling Images"]},"185":{"title":"A Few Examples of JSON Profile Settings","content":"This example shows settings used to downsample and recompress color JPEG images in a PDF document: \"color\": { \"downsample\": { \"trigger-dpi\": 225, \"target-dpi\": 150 }, \"recompress\": { \"type\": \"jpeg\", \"quality\": \"medium\" } }, Here images with a resolution above 225 DPI will be resized to 150 DPI, using the JPEG compression algorithm, and set at \"medium\" quality.  The quality levels (low, medium, high) are defined within the JPEG algorithm itself. In this example, we don’t provide recompress settings. \"color\": { \"downsample\": { \"trigger-dpi\": 225, \"target-dpi\": 150 }, }, PDF Optimizer will use the same compression algorithm, JPEG, because these types of images are by default JPEG compressed.  But the quality setting will be \"Maximum\" because the software tries to maintain the same level of compression quality as found in the original JPEG images. Finally, consider this example: \"color\": { \"downsample\": { \"trigger-dpi\": 225, \"target-dpi\": 150 }, \"recompress\": { \"type\": \"zip\" \"quality\": \"medium\" } }, This refers to the same type of image in the PDF document, color JPEG images.  PDF Optimizer will downsample the color images to 150 DPI if they are above 225 DPI, but uses the ZIP compression algorithm, rather than using the default JPEG compression method.","titles":["PDF Optimizer","Setting up your profile","Images","Downsampling Images"]},"186":{"title":"Images: Color","content":"downsample Ability to specify a target resolution and a trigger resolution at which color images will be recompressed. trigger-dpi All color images above this resolution will be downsampled. target-dpi The new resolution of downsampled color images. recompress Sets the type and quality of compression used to downsample color images.

It is a best practice when working with PDF documents to embed every font used in that document into the document itself. That way, the viewing tool (like Acrobat) does not have to look for a font on the local system, or choose a substitute. But embedding font files in a PDF document can make the PDF quite large, especially if the PDF has embedded a font file for an Asian language, such as Mandarin, with tens of thousands of glyphs. A glyph is a symbol that represents a character in a font.  For example, Times Roman has its own a glyph for the letter “a,” as does Helvetia, Courier, and Tempus sans.  The single letter, lower case a, could be expressed in a PDF file as any one of hundreds of different kinds of glyphs. To avoid this, a subset of the glyphs in the font can be saved in the PDF document. The subset font only includes the characters you expect to need when rendering the pages of that document. This often leads to a much smaller PDF. consolidate-duplicate-fonts Remove multiple copies of the same font file. Sometimes PDF documents are created with multiple copies of the same font, either as multiple subsets or multiple, fully embedded copies of a font file. When multiple copies of the same font appear, they may be merged into a single font. unembed-standard-14-fonts Remove the Base 14 fonts.  The Base 14 fonts are: ·         Times Roman ·         Helvetica ·         Courier ·         Symbol ·         Times Roman bold ·         Helvetica bold ·         Courier bold ·         ZapfDingbats ·         Times Roman italic ·         Helvetica oblique ·         Courier oblique ·         Times Roman bold/italic ·         Helvetica bold/oblique ·         Courier bold/oblique When these standard fonts are embedded in a PDF document they can make the file larger. resubset-subset-fonts Allows already subset fonts to be re-subset if possible (see “subset-embedded-fonts” above).  Subsetting can significantly reduce the size of the PDF document if a font features thousands of glyphs, such as Mandarin.

A PDF document can be set up to specify alternate images, or multiple versions of one image within the same document. These images can be used to meet different needs. For example, a PDF could present one image with a lower resolution for display on a monitor, and an alternate image with a higher resolution to use when the PDF document is sent to a printer. These images can make a PDF document very large.  Today alternate images are rarely used. discard-thumbnails Removes document thumbnails.  Thumbnail images are used to preview pages in a PDF document and appear in a panel on the left side of the viewer window.  A user could scroll through a series of thumbnails to find a page he or she is looking for. discard-document-tags Removes document tags.

If the output intent is present, rendering will be to that profile. PDF documents that are compliant with an ISO standard, like Graphics Exchange (PDF/X), Archive (PDF/A), and Engineering (PDF/E), often have an output intent set.

We can see thousands of different shades of colors, and high-quality digital cameras and scanners can often detect millions of shades.  To manage the broad range of colors for producing graphics images in digital content, imaging professionals have developed models to define these colors, called color spaces. Many color spaces have been defined.  Some are dependent on hardware devices, and define what a camera can detect, or a printer print, or a monitor display. Others are based on software and thus can be used across many different types of devices, such as Adobe RGB or sRGB (standard RGB).  A color space must be defined for any device or software product to make sure that coloring patterns remain the same from one device or system to another. The Standard RGB color space, sRGB, was developed by Microsoft and Hewlett Packard to describe colors available on most monitors and displays.  This color space is also commonly used for web graphics. Adobe Systems’ own Adobe RGB (Red/Green/Blue) color space is designed to hold all of the colors that are likely to be available on any color CMYK (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow/Black) printer.  It is considerably larger than Standard RGB. Color profiles are standards for managing colors, used to ensure that the colors for text or graphics in a file remain the same regardless of the hardware or software used to display, edit, or print that file. Color profiles are based on the specification created by the International Color Consortium (ICC) in 1993 to govern color and color management across all operating systems, platforms, and software and hardware and software systems.  A color profile is usually expressed as a file included in the software or driver for an installed printer, scanner, or other hardware device, or in software used to edit a file that is to be displayed or printed. A profile provides a set of data that describes an input or output device.  A color profile file can also be embedded in a PDF document. enabled Enables PDF Optimizer to convert colors in a PDF document using a target profile. convert-profile The profile used to convert colors in the PDF document. lab-d50 L*a*b color specification with a D50 white point. The Lab color space is based on the CIE XYZ color space, but it includes a dimension L, for lightness, along with a and b coordinates, to define the color. This is Adobe Systems’ standard Lab profile. srgb Standard RGB, the default profile for Windows monitors. apple-rgb Apple RGB, the default profile for Mac monitors color-match-rgb Color Match RGB. This is a simpler version of the Radius ColorMatch RGB space, without the non-zero black point. gamma-18 Gray Gamma 1.8, grayscale display profile, used for content viewed on a monitor gamma-22 Gray Gamma 2.2 dot-gain-10 Grayscale printer profile, with dot gain 10%. Dot gain is commonly used in offset printing to define the increase in size in halftone dots in the printing process, making a printed document look darker than intended. dot-gain-15 Dot gain 15% dot-gain-20 Dot gain 20% dot-gain-25 Dot gain 25% dot-gain-30 Dot gain 30% monitor-rgb RGB Monitor, referring to a monitor that requires separate signals for the three primary colors. acrobat5-cmyk Adobe Reader 5 CMYK acrobat9-cmyk Adobe Reader 9 CMYK The above list of options represents the standard list of color profiles provided with PDF Optimizer.  These color profiles are in the form of .icc profile files, and these files are stored in this directory after the product is installed: PDF Optimizer\\Resources\\Color\\Profiles If you enter one of these options, PDF Optimizer can find the correct color profile file. If you want to use your own custom color profile file, provide the full path name where the file is stored. We recommend that you put your color profile file in the same \\Resources  directory where the other color profile files are stored, but you can store it wherever you like. If you want to apply your own color profile, the convert-profile section of the JSON profile file might look like this: \"color-conversion\": { \"enabled\": \"on\", \"color-convert-action\": \"convert\", \"convert-intent\": \"profile-intent\", \"convert-profile\": \"C:\\Datalogics\\PDF                       Optimizer\\Resources\\Color\\                             Profiles\\custom_profile.icc\" }, color-convert-action The type of color conversion. The values available include convert and decalibrate. The decalibrate setting means that PDF Optimizer will decalibrate calibrated color spaces in the PDF document. If a color profile file is assigned to a PDF document, or to a feature in of that PDF document, such as an image, the document or image is referred to as “calibrated.” This color profile will be used when rendering colors for that document. If a color profile is not assigned to the document, a default color profile is used instead, usually installed on the local device or on a printer. So, if you select decalibrate as the color-conversion-option, you can remove the ICC profile file stored in the PDF document, and thus reduce the size of the PDF output file. convert-intent Use this setting to specify the color translation method for colors that are outside the gamut of the color profile.  The intent lets the software determine how to substitute a color that can be written to the file.  You can select from a list of standard strategies to apply when converting the colors in that original PDF document. The conversion intent is used to describe how the destination device for the document reproduces the colors in the document. Thus, when you print or display the PDF output file, the colors in the output file will match as closely as possible the original color found in the source PDF document. perceptual-intent Generally used for photography. This method does not map colors one for one but estimates to match colors. Hence it often provides the most pleasing result but not necessarily the most accurate. relative-colorimetric-intent Generally used for photography. The relative method uses an algorithm to select the closest possible color map to be true to the specified color. saturation-intent Commonly used in charts and diagrams with a limited palette of colors where hue is not as important. absolute-colorimetric-intent Often used to select a specific color or set of colors for drawings or designs. Absolute serves to reproduce the exact colors provided in the original PDF document. A common reason for using absolute would be to reproduce the color used in a corporate logo such as IBM Blue. The color is changed by selecting a defined match. This method does not use a conversion algorithm to select the closest color available. profile-intent If you specify a color profile in the convert-profile option the intent value defaults to that profile. In that case software will use the rendering intent provided with the ICC color profile currently in use for that PDF document.  For example, the Adobe RGB 1998 color profile uses Relative Colormetric as its rendering intent. So if you specify Adobe RGB 1998 (srgb) as the color profile, and profile-intent is selected here, the PDF Optimizer software will use relative. object-type Use this setting to specify what type of objects are included in the color conversion process.  This allows for more granular control over what types of objects are included or not during conversion. all Include all object types (images, text, line-art, and shading) during color conversion. images Include images during color conversion. text Include text during color conversion. line-art Include line-art during color conversion. shading Include smooth shadings during color conversion.","titles":["PDF Optimizer","Setting up your profile"]},"197":{"title":"PDF/A Conversion","content":"Optional.

Adobe introduced PDF in 1993, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) took management of PDF as an open standard in 2008. ISO released PDF/A in 2005. PDF/A is designed to be used with PDF files that need to be archived and stored, and still capable of being opened and read in a viewing tool many years into the future. Hence the standards for PDF/A files differ from regular PDF documents.

With PDF/A-3 a user can save an XML, CSV, CAD, spreadsheet, or other type of file in the PDF document and still conform to PDF/A standards.  The file embedded in the PDF/A-3 does not need to be converted to PDF/A itself. 3u Matches PDF/A-3b, but also requires that all text in the document have Unicode mapping. 4 Based on PDF 2.0 4e Based on PDF 2.0 for Engineering documents. 4f Based on PDF 2.0 for embedded files in any format. pdfa-target-color-space Select the target color space to use when converting the colors in the PDF document when converting it to PDF/A. rgb red green blue cmyk cyan magenta yellow black Rasterize-if-errors-encountered When set to OFF, if PDF Optimizer finds errors when saving the optimized PDF document as PDF/A compliant, PDF Optimizer ends the conversion to PDF/A and displays error message.

Grants Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license: under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version. 2.2. Effective Date The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution. 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor: for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions. This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4). 2.4. Subsequent Licenses No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3). 2.5. Representation Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License. 2.6. Fair Use This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents. 2.7. Conditions Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1. 3. Responsibilities 3.1. Distribution of Source Form All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form. 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License. 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s). 3.4. Notices You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 3.5. Application of Additional Terms You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5.1 Termination. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice. 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate. 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination. 6. Disclaimer of Warranty Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, you (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. 7. Limitation of Liability Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. 8. Litigation Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims. 9. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. 10. Versions of the License 10.1. New Versions Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 10.2. Effect of New Versions You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward. 10.3. Modified Versions If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License). 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible with Secondary Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible with Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached. Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, you can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0. If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice. You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership. Exhibit B - “Incompatible with Secondary Licenses” Notice This Source Code Form is “Incompatible with Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. WK<HTML>toPDF GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. Additional Definitions. As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked Version\". The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1, Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version: a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 4. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.","titles":["FLIP2PDF Software Acknowledgements"]},"257":{"title":"PDF2PRINT Guide","content":"Send batch file PDF documents to specific printers manually or with command prompt","titles":[]},"258":{"title":"PDF2PRINT Guide page","content":"","titles":[]},"259":{"title":"PDF2PRINT Release Notes","content":"PDF2PRINT Release Notes","titles":[]},"260":{"title":"Version 1.4.0 (April 23, 2019)","content":"Changes: Resolves issue where license extensions could fail without admin access to the installation directory.","titles":["PDF2PRINT Release Notes"]},"261":{"title":"Version 1.3.1 (January 4, 2019)","content":"Changes: Updates EULA","titles":["PDF2PRINT Release Notes"]},"262":{"title":"Version 1.1.1 (August 29, 2018)","content":"New Features: Adds support for printing multiple documents and specified page ranges in a single print jobAdds support for setting options and input files in JSON control fileAdds new parameter --orientation= to set the page orientation mode.
