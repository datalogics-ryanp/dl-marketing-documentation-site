Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.New APIs.

APDFL v18.0.0PlusP1b Initial Production Release (March 9, 2020) PDF version 2.0. Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files. Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available: *   International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1 *   Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9 *   Boost 1.71.0 *   iccProfLib 2.x/4.2 *   MoreFiles 1.5.4 *   MoreFilesX 1.0.1 *   zlib 1.2.11 *   libJPEG 9c *   libTIFF 4.1.0 *   libPNG 1.6.37 *   bzip2 1.08 *   gsl\\_microsoft, 2.0 *   Leptonica 1.67 *   Tesseract 3.05.01 Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly. Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS\\_PDFX, GTS\\_PDFA, or ISO\\_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment. PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects. UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer. New APIs. These new APIs were added to Adobe PDF Library in version 18: *   PDDocGetAdobePDFVersion *   PDDocSetAdobePDFVersion *   PDEExtGStateGetBPC *   PDEExtGStateSetBPC *   PDDocColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentEx *   PDPageColorConvertEmbedOutputIntent *   PDColorConvertPDEElementEx2 *   PDSysEncodingSetIsUTF16","titles":[]},"24":{"title":"Getting Started","content":"Getting Started with the APDFL C/C++ Interface","titles":[]},"25":{"title":"Introduction","content":"The Datalogics PDF Library includes a comprehensive set of APIs for your PDF manipulation needs.","titles":["Getting Started"]},"26":{"title":"Supported Environments","content":"OSArchitectureDevelopmentWindowsx64, x86Visual Studio 2022, 2019, or 2017`Linuxx86_64, ARM64, i686, all with glibc 2.17+Clang 3.9+, or gcc 4.8+macOSx64, ARM64Xcode 13+SolarisSPARC: sparv9, sparcv8gcc 4.8+, or Developer Studio 12.5+","titles":["Getting Started","Introduction"]},"27":{"title":"Getting Started","content":"","titles":["Getting Started"]},"28":{"title":"Introduction","content":"Built upon Adobe source code used for Acrobat, Datalogics Adobe PDF Library SDK provides stable, reliable code and the flexibility to develop with C++ (interfaces are also available for C#, VB (VB.NET), and Java).

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.New APIs. These new APIs were added to Adobe PDF Library in version 18:PDDocGetAdobePDFVersionPDDocSetAdobePDFVersionPDEExtGStateGetBPCPDEExtGStateSetBPCPDDocColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentExPDPageColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentPDColorConvertPDEElementEx2PDSysEncodingSetIsUTF16","titles":[]},"88":{"title":"Release Notes","content":"Adobe PDF Library v18 Release Notes - This page lists updates, fixes, changes and enhancements made to the Adobe PDF Library v18 provided by Datalogics..

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.New APIs. These new APIs were added to Adobe PDF Library in version 18:PDDocGetAdobePDFVersionPDDocSetAdobePDFVersionPDEExtGStateGetBPCPDEExtGStateSetBPCPDDocColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentExPDPageColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentPDColorConvertPDEElementEx2PDSysEncodingSetIsUTF16","titles":[]},"89":{"title":"Release Notes","content":"Adobe PDF Library v18 Release Notes - This page lists updates, fixes, changes and enhancements made to the Adobe PDF Library v18 provided by Datalogics..

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.New APIs. These new APIs were added to Adobe PDF Library in version 18:PDDocGetAdobePDFVersionPDDocSetAdobePDFVersionPDEExtGStateGetBPCPDEExtGStateSetBPCPDDocColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentExPDPageColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentPDColorConvertPDEElementEx2PDSysEncodingSetIsUTF16","titles":[]},"90":{"title":"Release Notes","content":"Adobe PDF Library v18 Release Notes - This page lists updates, fixes, changes and enhancements made to the Adobe PDF Library v18 provided by Datalogics..

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.New APIs. These new APIs were added to Adobe PDF Library in version 18:PDDocGetAdobePDFVersionPDDocSetAdobePDFVersionPDEExtGStateGetBPCPDEExtGStateSetBPCPDDocColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentExPDPageColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentPDColorConvertPDEElementEx2PDSysEncodingSetIsUTF16","titles":[]},"91":{"title":"Release Notes","content":"Adobe PDF Library v18 Release Notes - This page lists updates, fixes, changes and enhancements made to the Adobe PDF Library v18 provided by Datalogics..

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.New APIs. These new APIs were added to Adobe PDF Library in version 18:PDDocGetAdobePDFVersionPDDocSetAdobePDFVersionPDEExtGStateGetBPCPDEExtGStateSetBPCPDDocColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentExPDPageColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentPDColorConvertPDEElementEx2PDSysEncodingSetIsUTF16","titles":[]},"92":{"title":"Release Notes","content":"Adobe PDF Library v18 Release Notes - This page lists updates, fixes, changes and enhancements made to the Adobe PDF Library v18 provided by Datalogics..

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.New APIs. These new APIs were added to Adobe PDF Library in version 18:PDDocGetAdobePDFVersionPDDocSetAdobePDFVersionPDEExtGStateGetBPCPDEExtGStateSetBPCPDDocColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentExPDPageColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentPDColorConvertPDEElementEx2PDSysEncodingSetIsUTF16","titles":[]},"93":{"title":"Release Notes","content":"Adobe PDF Library v18 Release Notes - This page lists updates, fixes, changes and enhancements made to the Adobe PDF Library v18 provided by Datalogics..

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.New APIs. These new APIs were added to Adobe PDF Library in version 18:PDDocGetAdobePDFVersionPDDocSetAdobePDFVersionPDEExtGStateGetBPCPDEExtGStateSetBPCPDDocColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentExPDPageColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentPDColorConvertPDEElementEx2PDSysEncodingSetIsUTF16","titles":[]},"94":{"title":"Release Notes","content":"Adobe PDF Library v18 Release Notes - This page lists updates, fixes, changes and enhancements made to the Adobe PDF Library v18 provided by Datalogics..

Adobe PDF Library can now read and edit PDF 2.0 version PDF files.Current open source software. With this release of Adobe PDF Library, we have updated a variety of open source vendor software products to the most current versions available:International Components for Unicode (ICU) 65.1Expat XML Parser (Expat) 2.2.9Boost 1.71.0iccProfLib 2.x/4.2MoreFiles 1.5.4MoreFilesX 1.0.1zlib 1.2.11libJPEG 9clibTIFF 4.1.0libPNG 1.6.37bzip2 1.08gsl_microsoft, 2.0Leptonica 1.67Tesseract 3.05.01Black Point Compensation. The product now provides additional support for Black Point Compensation (BPC). BPC is a method that allows for adjustments in handling black text and graphics between digital files and printers and output devices. The Adobe RGB color space can offer a maximum possible black and white density for content in a digital document, which is beyond the capacity of most printers available. So BPC is used to adjust the density of black content in a file to match the capability of the intended printer or other output device. Black characters or content in images is mapped to the black available on the printer, and other tones are adjusted accordingly.Expanded support for Output Intent. Adobe PDF Library now provides support for applying an Output Intent to an individual page in a PDF document, so that the value can vary from one page to another. A subtype, GTS_PDFX, GTS_PDFA, or ISO_PDFE1 can be added to the output profile as per the value passed to the appropriate API. An output intent is set of dictionaries stored in the PDF document’s OutputIntents array. More than one output intent may be imbedded in an output intent array within a PDF document, each with its own color profile and characteristics. This allows the PDF document to adapt to a variety of workflows or production environments. Each output intent features several dictionary key values, including OutputCondition and an OutputConditionIdentifier. Both of these values are text strings that describe the intended output device for this PDF document or the production environment.PDEElement color space support. Support has been added for conversion to a PDEElement to a color space supplied by the user. The PDFEdit Layer (PDE) of the Adobe Acrobat API contains classes that provide for editing in PDF documents including color spaces, clip and page objects, fonts, form XObjects, and other objects. The PDEElement is a base class for PDE, used to derive a variety of elements within a PDF document, including text and XObjects.UTF-16 support. The Library can now check if an encoding is 16 bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) or not. UTF-16BE is a Unicode character encoding method, mapping code points of each Unicode character set to a sequence of two bytes (16 bits). UTF-16BE encodes, or serializes, Unicode characters into a byte stream so that the characters can be stored or distributed. The stream is divided into blocks of two bytes each, and each block of two bytes is converted to a 16-bit integer.New APIs. These new APIs were added to Adobe PDF Library in version 18:PDDocGetAdobePDFVersionPDDocSetAdobePDFVersionPDEExtGStateGetBPCPDEExtGStateSetBPCPDDocColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentExPDPageColorConvertEmbedOutputIntentPDColorConvertPDEElementEx2PDSysEncodingSetIsUTF16","titles":[]},"95":{"title":"Release Notes","content":"shadcn-docs-nuxt is a Nuxt documentation template built with Nuxt Content and shadcn-vue.","titles":[]},"96":{"title":"Motivations","content":"shadcn-docs-nuxt is created as an free alternative documentation solution to Docus and Nuxt UI Pro Docs.","titles":["Release Notes"]},"97":{"title":"Features","content":"Free and open source.Fully customizable.Rich components to work with.Mobile support.Indexed searching powered by Nuxt Content.Partial component compatibility with Docus, Nuxt UI Pro Docs, undocs.","titles":["Release Notes"]},"98":{"title":"Credits","content":"Nuxt Content: Content made easy for Vue Developers.shadcn-ui: For the beautiful component & docs design.shadcn-vue: For the vue port of shadcn-ui & some docs component source.Docus: For inspiration & some docs component source.Nuxt UI Pro Docs: For inspiration.","titles":["Release Notes"]},"99":{"title":"License","content":"MIT","titles":["Release Notes"]},"100":{"title":"Home","content":"Effortless and Beautiful  Docs Template.Beautifully designed Nuxt Content template built with shadcn-vue.
